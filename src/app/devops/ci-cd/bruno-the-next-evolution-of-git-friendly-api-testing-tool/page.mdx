What makes v3 special? It's all about **freedom and collaboration**. No vendor lock-in, no forced cloud sync. Everything lives as plain files on your machine, perfect for version control with Git. Diffs are clean, merges are painless, and you can edit requests in your favorite IDE.

**Why switch now?** The preview is stable for everyday use, and YAML is set to become the default in February 2026 (with full support for older formats continuing). Starting early means your collections are future-proof, CI/CD-ready, and optimized for team workflows. If you value open-source tools that respect your data and workflow, Bruno v3 is a no-brainer.

## Unlock the Magic of OpenCollection: YAML Format and Seamless CI/CD Integration

One of Bruno v3's biggest wins is adopting the **OpenCollection** format—an open standard for API collections stored as simple YAML files.

Why is this a game-changer?
- **Truly Open-Source**: No proprietary magic. Anyone can build tools around it.
- **Git-Optimized**: Human-readable files mean beautiful, meaningful diffs (goodbye, noisy changes!).
- **Editor-Friendly**: Tweak requests in VS Code, Vim, or any text editor.
- **Perfect for Automation**: Use Bruno's CLI to run collections headless in pipelines like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

Imagine generating API tests programmatically or running automated checks on every pull request—YAML makes it effortless. It's the foundation for a more extensible, team-friendly future.

## How to Create YAML Collections and Requests in Bruno v3 (With Practical Examples)

Getting started is easy:
1. Download the v3 preview and create a new collection.
2. Select **YAML** as the format.
3. Bruno sets up a folder with `.yml` files—you can build via the UI or edit directly.

### Simple GET Request Example

Here's a basic `get-users.yml`:

```yaml
uid: get-users
name: Get All Users
type: http-request

request:
  method: GET
  url: https://api.example.com/users

docs: |
  # Fetch User List

  Retrieves all users from the system.

  **Success Response**:
  - 200 OK
  - JSON array of users
```

### Advanced POST Request with Headers, Body, and Params

Try this `create-user.yml`:

```yaml
uid: create-user
name: Create New User
type: http-request

request:
  method: POST
  url: https://api.example.com/users
  headers:
    - key: Content-Type
      value: application/json
    - key: Authorization
      value: Bearer {{auth_token}}
  params:
    - key: source
      value: bruno
      enabled: true
  body:
    mode: json
    json: |
      {
        "name": "{{user_name}}",
        "email": "{{user_email}}"
      }

docs: |
  # Add a User

  Creates a new account with the given details.
```

### Adding Pre-Request and Post-Request Scripts

Scripts run JavaScript with Bruno's handy `bru` API for dynamic logic and tests.

```yaml
script:
  prerequest: |
    // Set a timestamp variable
    bru.setVar('timestamp', new Date().toISOString());

    // Generate and pass a value to the next request
    const randomId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);
    bru.setNextRequestVar('generated_id', randomId);

    console.log('Running pre-request setup!');

  postrequest: |
    // Basic assertions (these act as tests)
    bru.assert(response.status === 201);
    bru.assertJsonPath('$.id', response.body.json);

    // Extract data for later use
    const newUserId = response.body.json.id;
    bru.setVar('created_user_id', newUserId);

    console.log('Post-request checks complete!');
```

Failed assertions mark the request as failed—perfect for collection runners.

## Mastering Environments in Bruno v3

Environments let you swap variables effortlessly between dev, staging, and production. In the v3 preview you can store environment files as YAML (or JSON) — YAML is recommended for readability and consistency with OpenCollection.

Create files like `environments/dev.env.yml` in your collection folder:

```yaml
# environments/dev.env.yml
base_url: https://dev.api.example.com
auth_token: dev-secret-token
```

Use them in requests the same way: `url: {{base_url}}/users`.

Switch environments in the UI or via CLI (`bru run --env dev`). Environment variables override collection- and folder-level variables, keeping your tests flexible and secure.

Using a local `.env` file

If you prefer to keep secrets out of collection files, you can add a local `.env` file at the collection root (not the same as the YAML env files). This file is loaded into the process environment at runtime and is useful for developer-local secrets or CI runners that read environment files.

Example `.env` (collection root):

```
# .env
KEY1=supersecretvalue
API_KEY=abcdef123456
```

How to reference process env vars

- In YAML requests and templates, reference process env variables with Bruno's process interpolation syntax, for example: `{{$processEnv.KEY1}}`.
- In request scripts (pre/post request) you can also access them via `process.env.KEY1` (the script runtime exposes the process env).

Examples:

Request header using a process env value:

```yaml
headers:
  - key: Authorization
    value: Bearer {{$processEnv.API_KEY}}
```

Pre-request script example using `process.env`:

```yaml
script:
  prerequest: |
    // read process env directly in the script
    const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY || bru.getProcessEnv('API_KEY');
    bru.setVar('api_key', apiKey);
```

Security and .gitignore

Never commit your `.env` files to the repo. Add a simple `.gitignore` entry at the collection root:

```
# ignore local environment secrets
.env
```

If you need private environment files checked into a secure store, prefer encrypted secrets or your CI provider's secret storage instead of committing plaintext files.

## Understanding Folder Structure, Settings, and Configurations

YAML collections are beautifully simple directories:

```
my-awesome-api/
├── bruno.json              # Collection metadata, variables, auth
├── collection.yml          # Upcoming: Collection-level config
├── environments/
│   ├── dev.env.yml
│   └── prod.env.yml
├── users/
│   ├── get-users.yml
│   ├── create-user.yml
│   └── folders.yml  # Folder-specific vars (optional)
└── posts/
    └── list-posts.yml
```

Sample `folders.yml` (folder-level variables)

```yaml
# users/folders.yml
# Variables and small settings applied to all requests in the `users` folder
base_path: /users
default_role: tester
folder_auth_token: folder-specific-token
```

Usage example in a request inside `users/`:

```yaml
request:
  method: GET
  url: {{base_url}}{{base_path}}
  headers:
    - key: Authorization
      value: Bearer {{folder_auth_token}}
```

Place a local `.env` file at the collection root (the same directory that contains `bruno.json` or `collection.yml`) so Bruno loads those values into the process environment at runtime. Do not place `.env` inside the `environments/` folder — keep it at the collection root and add it to `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets.

Settings flow down: collection → folder → request. This mirrors your API structure and makes organization intuitive.

## Variables Demystified: How to Use Them in Requests and Scripts

Variables make your requests dynamic and reusable. Scopes prioritize: request > folder > collection > environment > system env.

- **In Requests**: Just wrap with `{{}}`, e.g., `{{base_url}}` or `{{auth_token}}`.
- **In Scripts**:
  ```js
  bru.getVar('my_var');           // Read
  bru.setVar('new_var', 'hello'); // Set for current run
  bru.setEnvVar('api_key', 'abc'); // Environment-specific
  ```

Built-ins like `{{timestamp}}` or `{{randomId}}` add quick magic. Process env vars? Use `{{$processEnv.SECRET_KEY}}`.
